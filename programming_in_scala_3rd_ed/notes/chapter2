=> Packages in scala are similar to packages in Java. They partition the global namespace and provide
a mechanism for information hiding.

=> All of Java's primitive types have corresponding classes in the 'scala' Pacakage.
	scala.Int corresponds to Java 'int'
	scala.Boolean corresponds to Java 'boolean'
	scala.Float corresponds to Java 'float' and so on...
	
	And when Scala code is compiled to Java bytecode then Scala compiler will use Java's primitive 
	types 'where possible' to give the performance benefits of the primitive types.
